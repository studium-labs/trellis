Trellis is a set of tools that helps you publish your markdown notes as a [digital garden](https://studium.dev/) website for free.
Trellis is currently pre-alpha and we can't yet recommend using this project seriously yet. To see our current progress you can view [the roadmap here](./content/roadmap-and-changelog.md).

## Thank you Quartz Creators!

Quartz is the original inspiration and the author(s) of lots of styling and HTML code found in this project. Check them out to learn who/what inspired me to build the Rust version!
