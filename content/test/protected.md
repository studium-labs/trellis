This is a top secret document blah blah blah...

Hi, I’m jerlendds. You’ve stumbled upon my working notes, a collection of interconnected thoughts, projects, and odds & ends for my personal knowledge base. These notes are mostly written for myself, here you’ll find me exploring my work, quotes I like, graphs, notes, osintbuddy, good and bad ideas, blogs, technical topics, privacy, various links, and in the future, I suspect there will be many other things.

These notes grow organically, they’re leaves made of links, the garden behind my mind, some are polished thoughts, others are still covered in soil; They’re nothing more than drafted sketches. Think of it as learning in public.

All the best,

jerlendds

P.S. Here are some quotes I like:

> [!cite] Strange how certain arrangements of words sear themselves into your mind...
> Then they wait. A day or a decade later, like a song you catch yourself humming, you realize those words have been quietly shaping your beliefs, your actions, your identity.
